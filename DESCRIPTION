Description: Methods for analyzing and using quartets displayed on a collection of gene trees, 
      primarily to make inferences about the species tree or network under the multi-species 
      coalescent model. These include quartet hypothesis tests for the model, as developed by 
      Mitchell et al. (2019) <doi:10.1214/19-EJS1576>, the species tree inference routines 
      based on quartet distances of Rhodes (2019) <doi:10.1109/TCBB.2019.2917204> and 
      Yourdkhani and Rhodes (2019), and the NANUQ algorithm for inference of level-1 
      species networks of Allman et al. (2019) <arXiv:1905.07050>.
