\title{Topological distances on a tree}
\usage{
topDist(tree, epsilon = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{a phylo object, with or without edge lengths}

\item{epsilon}{a tolerance, so all edges shorter than epsilon are contracted}
}
\value{
a distance table, with rows and columns named by taxa
}
\description{
Compute a pairwise table of topological distances from a tree, after contracting short edges
}
